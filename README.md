# Divert.Net

.NET Wrapper for [WinDivert](https://github.com/basil00/Divert), available under the very permissive MIT License. 

##Goals

 - Wrap WinDivert in a fully managed, easy to use CLR library.
 - Provide helpful extensions for commonly desired tasks, such as the ability to identify the process behind a packet flow.
 - Win?

Currently this project is a WIP. A basic C# example program that sniffs and logs network traffic to the console exists and is functional, ~~but nothing has been tested beyond that~~. 

The tests from WinDivert have been ported and all tests are passing. First release coming soon with an upload to nuget.

Before trying to build, there's a very small amount of configuration required, all of which is explained on the [Wiki page](https://github.com/TechnikEmpire/Divert.Net/wiki).
